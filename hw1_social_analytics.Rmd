## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r import_files, echo = F}
library(igraph)
library(data.table)
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

``` {r read_data, echo = T}
data1 <- read.csv("C:\\Users\\jaern\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\social_networking_analytics\\HW1\\social_and_task_network.csv", sep = ",", head= T)

setwd("C:\\Users\\jaern\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\social_networking_analytics\\HW1")

head(data1)
```

##Queston 1

As the excercise requested, I considered social and task as separate networks
``` {r social and task, echo = T}
df_social <- data1[,1:3]
df_task <- data1[,c(1,2,4)]
```

Then, I filtered out the social and task ties that were significant (higher than the mean)
``` {r social, echo = T}
#this filters out the social_ties that exist between two individuals
df_social_mod <- filter(df_social, social_tie > 0)

social_gd <- graph_from_data_frame(df_social_mod, directed = T)
plot(social_gd)
```
```{r task, echo = T}
df_task_mod <- filter(df_task, task_tie > 0)

task_gd <- graph_from_data_frame(df_task_mod, directed = T)
plot(task_gd)
```

##1A
Calculate in degree, out degree, closeness, betweeness, and the page rank centrallity of both social and task ties

First task:
```{r degree_for_task, echo = T}
#indegree of task tie dataframe filtered out to see only relationships
in_df_task_mod <- degree(task_gd, mode = "in")
out_df_task_mod <- degree(task_gd, mode = "out")
closeness_df_task_mod <- closeness(task_gd, mode = "total")
betweeness_task <- betweenness(task_gd, normalized = TRUE)
page_rank_task <- page_rank(task_gd, directed = T)
```

```{r indegree of task, echo = T}
#in degree
in_df_task_mod
```

```{r outdegree_of_task, echo =T}
#out degree
out_df_task_mod


```

```{r closeness_task}
#closeness of task
closeness_df_task_mod


```

```{r betweenness_task}
#betweenness of task
betweeness_task

```

```{r page_rank_of_task, echo = T}
#page rank of task
page_rank_task
```
Now for social:
```{r}
#calculations for 1A
in_df_social_mod <- degree(social_gd, mode = "in")
out_df_social_mod <- degree(social_gd, mode = "out")
closeness_df_social_mod <- closeness(social_gd, mode ="total")
betweeness_social <- betweenness(social_gd, normalized = T)
page_rank_social <- page_rank(social_gd, directed = T)
```

```{r indegree}
in_df_social_mod
```

```{r outdegree}
out_df_social_mod
```

```{r closeness}
closeness_df_social_mod
```

```{r betweenness}
betweeness_social
```


```{r page_rank}
page_rank_social
```

##1B
I put all the component of social and task together to later merge them together to analyze their correlation
``` {r merge_all}
#social into one dataframe
#we used the first column of page_ranks because we only want vectors only
social_dt <- data.frame(in_df_social_mod, out_df_social_mod, closeness_df_social_mod, betweeness_social, page_rank_social[1])

#task into one dataframe
task_dt <- data.frame(in_df_task_mod, out_df_task_mod, closeness_df_task_mod, betweeness_task, page_rank_task[1])
```

I joined it using the merge function
```{r 1B}
#1b
#join the two data
total_df <- merge(social_dt, task_dt, by.x=0, by.y=0)
```

And this will output the correlation between the two: social and task
```{r correlation between the two}
cor(total_df[,2:6],total_df[,7:11])
```
After looking at the correlation, I realized that the betweenness of both social and task had the highest correlation. This is a significant find as we now know that individuals who have high betweenness mean that they have a higher influence on the transfer of information throughout the network, and the correlation tells us that those who have high influence in social relationships will inherently have high influence in their task relationships as well

##Question 2
I filtered out the data to consider both social and task that did not have a 0 in their relationship
```{r calculate_mean}
data_mod <- filter(data1, social_tie > 0 | task_tie > 0)
#get mean value of social ties
mean_social <- mean(subset(data_mod, social_tie > 0)$social_tie)
#get mean value of task ties; use modified version (tasktie>0) since it is conditional to having the ties
mean_task <-  mean(subset(data_mod, task_tie > 0)$task_tie)
```

I set the ones that were higher than its mean as strong and if they were less than the mean i considered them as weak.

The result can tell you more on what I have done on data_mod
```{r set_strong}
data_mod$social_strength <- ifelse(data_mod$social_tie > mean_social, 'Strong', 'Weak')
data_mod$tie_strength <- ifelse(data_mod$task_tie > mean_task, 'Strong', 'Weak')

data_mod
```

Next to make the graph more readable, I colored the strong ones as green and weak ones as red
``` {r make_graph}
g3 <- graph_from_data_frame(data_mod, directed = TRUE, vertices = unique(data1[,1]))                            

#setting colors for strong and weak ties
E(g3)$color[E(g3)$social_strength == "Strong" | E(g3)$tie_strength == "Strong" ] <- 'Green'
E(g3)$color[E(g3)$social_strength == "Weak" & E(g3)$tie_strength == "Weak" ] <- 'Red'


#plot the graph
plot(g3, edge.arrow.size = .15)
```

```{r 2b}
#2b
#this tells us how many percentage of the nodes that are violating the triadic closure
## around 68% of the network violates strong triadic closure 
strong=data_mod%>%filter(data_mod$social_strength=="Strong" | data_mod$tie_strength=="Strong")
g_strong=graph_from_edgelist(as.matrix(strong[,c(1,2)]),directed = TRUE)
matrix_strong=as_adjacency_matrix(g_strong)
matrix_total=as_adjacency_matrix(g3)

path=matrix_strong%*%matrix_strong

total_tie <- nrow(df_social_mod) + nrow(df_task_mod)
p <- sum((matrix_total==0&path!=0))/total_tie
1-p
```
This tells us how many percentage of the nodes that are violating the triadic closure
Around 68% of the network violates strong triadic closure

```{r 3_get_betweeness}
social_betweenness = edge_betweenness(g3, e = E(g3)[get.edge.attribute(g3, name = "social_tie")!= 0])
social_betweenness

task_betweenness = edge_betweenness(g3, e=E(g3)[get.edge.attribute(g3,name = "task_tie")!= 0])
task_betweenness
```

```{r graph the plot}
library(ggplot2)

df_social_mod$social_strength <- factor(df_social_mod$social_tie > mean_social, labels = c('weak', 'Strong'))

df_social_mod$social_tie <- as.factor(df_social_mod$social_tie)

ggplot(df_social_mod, aes(x = social_tie, y= social_betweenness, color = social_strength)) + geom_point()


df_task_mod$task_strength <- factor(df_task_mod$task_tie > mean_task, labels = c('weak', 'Strong'))
df_task_mod$task_tie <- as.factor(df_task_mod$task_tie)
ggplot(df_task_mod, aes(x = task_tie, y=task_betweenness, color =task_strength)) + geom_point()
```

##3B
high betweenness depends on the overall network structure. If the edge is a bridge that connect a node to the overall network then it will have a high edge_betweenness
if it is not bridge and there are multiple different routes to get to the same node, then it will have a lower edge_betweenness


##Question 4

```{r question_4}
mtx <- as_adjacency_matrix(g3, sparse = FALSE)
mtx_2 <- mtx%*%mtx
mtx_3 <- mtx_2%*%mtx
mtx_4 <- mtx_3%*%mtx
mtx_5 <- mtx_4%*%mtx
sum(mtx_2 == 0)
sum(mtx_3 == 0)
sum(mtx_4 == 0)
sum(mtx_5 == 0)

dist_mtx <- distances(g3)
sum(dist_mtx == "Inf")
```

the matrix function functions differently than the distance function. It is not as accurate to use distance function in this case because when we run the different powers of matrix (which is getting the number of walks equalling to however many times you raise the power of) it gives us different answers. For example, the nodes of 4 and 8 which is separate from the network itself, it has walks for length of 1,3, and 5 but not for 2 or 4. However when distance function is used it does not capture the same result as the matrix function.

##Question 5
```{r 5}
#5

star = make_star(20, "undirected")
plot(star)
centr_degree(star)
total_Cdegree<-sum(centralization.degree(star,mode="all")$res)
(1/((20-1)*(20-2)))*(20*max(centralization.degree(star,mode="all")$res)-total_Cdegree)


ring = make_ring(20)
plot(ring)
total_Cdegree<-sum(centralization.degree(ring,mode="all")$res)
(1/((20-1)*(20-2)))*(20*max(centralization.degree(ring,mode="all")$res)-total_Cdegree) 


# closeness does not have same results as the star graph since it is not 1
total_Clodegree_star<-sum(centralization.closeness(star,mode="total")$res)
(1/((20-1)*(20-2)))*(20*max(centralization.closeness(star,mode="total")$res)-total_Clodegree_star)

total_Clodegree_ring<-sum(centralization.closeness(ring,mode="total")$res)
(1/((20-1)*(20-2)))*(20*max(centralization.closeness(ring,mode="total")$res)-total_Clodegree_ring)

# betweenness does not have same results as the star graph since it is not 1
total_Btwdegree<-sum(centralization.betweenness(star,directed = TRUE)$res)
(1/((20-1)*(20-2)))*(20*max(centralization.betweenness(star,directed = TRUE)$res)-total_Btwdegree)


total_Btwdegree<-sum(centralization.betweenness(ring,directed = FALSE)$res)
(1/((20-1)*(20-2)))*(20*max(centralization.betweenness(ring,directed = FALSE)$res)-total_Btwdegree)

#it makes sense that betweenness will be equal because since the shape is in a circular shape with the ring
#then the bewteenness will have to all be the same
```
 the star network has network-level measure of degree centrality of 1 and
 the ring network has network-level measure of degree centrality of 0.
 
 The star's betweeness and closeness differ whereas the ring's betweenness and closeness does not
